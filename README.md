# Katie's Portfolio: The Next Generation

This repo contains a professional portfolio based on the [html5up miniport](https://html5up.net/miniport) theme, but converted to use Jekyll so that text can be written in markdown and the HTML/CSS can be (somewhat) modularized.

## Installation

To build this site locally, you must first install Jekyll by running the following command:

```
sudo gem install bundler jekyll
```

## Updating the site

After that, you can build your site by running the following command in the top-level directory:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve 2>/dev/null
````

The site should now be available at http://localhost:4000.

## Structure

Here is a guide to the files in the site that you might want to edit:

 * index.html: The top-level file. It simply includes html files from the \_includes directory.
 * \_includes/: The directory containing code to render the sections of the home page.
 * images/: Location of images and screenshots.
 * resources/: Location of resume, papers not online elsewhere.


## Misc todo

  * Delete high school from LinkedIn.
